(/ˈnɛtflɪks/) is an American media-services provider and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California, founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs, including those produced in-house.[12] As of April 2020, Netflix had over 182 million paid subscriptions worldwide, including 69 million in the United States.[13] It is available worldwide except in the following: Mainland China (Due to local restrictions), Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (Due to U.S. sanctions). The company also has offices in Brazil, Netherlands, India, Japan and South Korea.[14] Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).</p>

<p style="color: red">Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, but Hastings abandoned the sales about a year after the company's founding to focus on the initial DVD rental business.[12][15] Netflix expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental business. The company expanded internationally in 2010 with streaming available in Canada,[16] followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series House of Cards.</p>

<p style="color: red">Since 2012, Netflix has taken more of an active role as producer and distributor for both film and television series (latest: The Last Dance) and to that end, it offers a variety of "Netflix Original" content through its online library.[17] By January 2016, Netflix services operated in more than 190 countries.[18] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[19] Their efforts to produce new content, secure the rights for additional content, and diversify through 190 countries have resulted in the company racking up billions in debt: $21.9 billion as of September 2017, up from $16.8 billion from the previous year.[20] $6.5 billion of this is long-term debt, while the remaining is in long-term obligations.[21] In October 2018, Netflix announced it would raise another $2 billion in debt to help fund new content.[22]</p>
